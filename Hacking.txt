# Hacking Version 7
# This is a graphical password guessing game that displays a
# list of potential computer passwords. The player is allowed
# up to 4 attempts to guess the password. Each time the user
# guesses incorrectly, the number of correct letters in their
# correct locations is displayed and the user is prompted to
# make a new guess. The game indicates whether the player
# successfully guessed the password or not.
